/* seems to work properly, (mattermost on openbsd that is) */ 
/* but it seems like the plugins that you install can not be enabled since mattermost only compiles said plugins for
/* FreeBSD, Linux and Darwin (mac) */ 

/* What did i do to try to fix this? */ 

/* in the makefile of a go plugin for mattermost you can find a 'go build' command for specific architectures + OS */

/* i used this to hack my own command that looked something like this: */ 
/* cd server && env GOOS=openbsd GOARCH=amd64 $(GO) build $(GO_BUILD_FLAGS) -gcflags "all=-N -l" -o dist/plugin/openbsd-amd64; */

/* safe to say, that did not work */
